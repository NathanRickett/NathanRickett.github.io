      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> So, you or your organization have an idea for a new system or group of systems that you’d like to get up and running... 
        exciting! I’m sure many bright techs and engineers are eager to do what they do best and start the process of 
        implementing it, but there’s a few preparations that must be made before you’re ready to start building. Risks exist at 
        every element of a system and establishing a strong foundation before implementation results in reduced costs and 
        complexity, informed risk-based decision making, a clear governance structure, and a smoother integration.   </p>
      <p></p>

    <section class="links" id="system-design">
      <h2>System Design</h2>
      <p> Contractor-developed, unclassified web system that supports public
        communication for the U.S. Air Force. This system is hosted and managed
        by a defense contractor and must comply with federal cybersecurity
        requirements (e.g., NIST RMF, NIST SP 800-53 Low/Moderate baseline).

      <h1>Prepare Phase Structure</h1>
      <p> The Prepare step of the NIST Risk Management Framework sets
        organizational context and lays the foundation for all subsequent RMF
        activities. It is divided into two tiers of tasks: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organization-level tasks (P1–P7): establish governance, strategy,
          and monitoring at enterprise scale.</li>
        <li>System-level tasks (P8–P17): tailor controls and define scope for
          the specific information system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

    <section id="org-level-tasks">
      <h2>Organization-Level Tasks</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P1: Risk Management Roles</summary>
        <p> Identify and assign individuals to specific roles associated with
          security and privacy risk management. Define who serves as the
          Authorizing Official (AO), Risk Executive, CISO, etc., across all
          projects. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P2: Risk Management Strategy</summary>
        <p> Establish how the company handles risk—for example, “We accept low
          risk, mitigate moderate, avoid high.” Document risk tolerance,
          decision criteria, and approval processes. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P3: Risk Assessment – Organization</summary>
        <p> Evaluate threats to all company systems (e.g., insider threats,
          supply chain risks). Determine assessment methodologies, frequency,
          and reporting formats. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P4: Tailored Control Baselines (Optional)</summary>
        <p> Customize <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final">NIST
            SP 800-53 Rev.5</a> Low/Moderate baselines for all unclassified DoD

          parameter changes.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P5: Common Control Identification</summary>
        <p> Define shared controls such as firewall rules (pfSense), centralized
          logging (Wazuh), and patch management (WSUS). Map which systems
          inherit these controls.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Task P6: Impact-Level Prioritization</summary>
        <p> If multiple systems are in development, prioritize based on mission
          impact and sensitivity. Use impact ratings (Low/Moderate/High) to
          sequence work and resource allocation. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P7: Continuous Monitoring Strategy – Org</summary>
