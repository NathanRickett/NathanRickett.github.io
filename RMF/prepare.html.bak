      <h2>System Design</h2>
      <p> Contractor-developed, unclassified web system that supports public
        communication for the U.S. Air Force. This system is hosted and managed
        by a defense contractor and must comply with federal cybersecurity
        requirements (e.g., NIST RMF, NIST SP 800-53 Low/Moderate baseline).</p>

      <h2>Prepare Phase Structure</h2>
      <p> The Prepare step of the NIST Risk Management Framework sets
        organizational context and lays the foundation for all subsequent RMF
        activities. It is divided into two tiers of tasks: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organization-level tasks (P1–P7): establish governance, strategy,
          and monitoring at enterprise scale.</li>
        <li>System-level tasks (P8–P17): tailor controls and define scope for
          the specific information system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section id="org-level-tasks">
      <h2>Organization-Level Tasks</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P1: Risk Management Roles</summary>
        <p> Identify and assign individuals to specific roles associated with
          security and privacy risk management. Define who serves as the
          Authorizing Official (AO), Risk Executive, CISO, etc., across all
          projects. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P2: Risk Management Strategy</summary>
        <p> Establish how the company handles risk—for example, “We accept low
          risk, mitigate moderate, avoid high.” Document risk tolerance,
          decision criteria, and approval processes. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P3: Risk Assessment – Organization</summary>
        <p> Evaluate threats to all company systems (e.g., insider threats,
          supply chain risks). Determine assessment methodologies, frequency,
          and reporting formats. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P4: Tailored Control Baselines (Optional)</summary>
        <p> Customize NIST SP 800-53 Low/Moderate baselines for all unclassified
          DoD projects. Document justifications for additions, deletions, or
          parameter changes. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P5: Common Control Identification</summary>
        <p> Define shared controls such as firewall rules (pfSense), centralized
          logging (Wazuh), and patch management (WSUS). Map which systems
          inherit these controls.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P6: Impact-Level Prioritization</summary>
        <p> If multiple systems are in development, prioritize based on mission
          impact and sensitivity. Use impact ratings (Low/Moderate/High) to
          sequence work and resource allocation. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P7: Continuous Monitoring Strategy – Org</summary>
        <p> Define how all systems will be monitored—e.g., Wazuh agents, weekly
          vulnerability scans, monthly audits, and reporting cadence to risk
          owners. </p>

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P9: Identify Stakeholders</summary>
        <p> List system owner (contractor PM), end users (Air Force public
          affairs), developers, and ISSO. Capture roles and points of contact. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P10: Asset Identification</summary>

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Task P11: Authorization Boundary</summary>
        <p> Define in-scope components: web server, firewall, logging
